Q.1 
Demonstrate, create and use user-defined data type, using C++ Class Department with data members deptId, name and totalEmp, overload the operator + for Department class to sum the totalEmp. Use parametric Constructor 
Department(int id, string name, int ecount) to initialize these data members. 

Department dept1(100,"COMP",10); 
Department dept2(20,"MATH", 20);

cout<<dept1 + dept2;
should return sum of totalEmp i.e. 30


Q.2
Write a program that accesses predefined template-class vector in code libraries to 
find and print min, max,  and "centered average", use pre-initialized data. Use for/while loop to solve this problem.

"centered average" is the mean average of the values,
except ignoring the largest and smallest values. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. 

centeredAverage({5, 3, 3, 4, 8},5) == 4
centeredAverage({-1, 1, 6, 4, 9, 8, 7},7) == 5
centeredAverage({-15, -5, -1, -3, -3, 1},6) == -3


Q.3
Demonstrate the use of pointers and dynamic memory allocation using Employee class with name as dynamic data (string pointer ) Load the employee data from a file empData.txt using file stream, and use Copy constructor to deep copy the employee data.

Create a text data file empData.txt with the following Id, Name, and dept data to read from this C++ program.

101,Employee1,10


Q.4
Create an abstract base class Number with abstract function print, derive the Complex class from the base class Number, and overload + and - to add and subtract complex numbers.
